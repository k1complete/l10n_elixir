#. TRANSLATORS: Elixir.Application Summary
#: lib/application.ex:1 
msgid ""
"A module for working with applications and defining application callbacks.\n"
"\n"
"In Elixir (actually, in Erlang/OTP), an application is a component\n"
"implementing some specific functionality, that can be started and stopped\n"
"as a unit, and which can be re-used in other systems as well.\n"
"\n"
"Applications are defined with an application file named `APP.app` where\n"
"`APP` is the APP name, usually in `underscore_case` convention. The\n"
"application file must reside in the same `ebin` directory as the\n"
"application's modules bytecode.\n"
"\n"
"In Elixir, Mix is responsible for compiling your source code and\n"
"generating your application `.app` file. Furthermore, Mix is also\n"
"responsible for configuring, starting and stopping your application\n"
"and its dependencies. For this reason, this documentation will focus\n"
"on the remaining aspects of your application: the application environment,\n"
"and the application callback module.\n"
"\n"
"You can learn more about Mix compilation of `.app` files by typing\n"
"`mix help compile.app`.\n"
"\n"
"## Application environment\n"
"\n"
"Once an application is started, OTP provides an application environment\n"
"that can be used to configure applications.\n"
"\n"
"Assuming you are inside a Mix project, you can edit your application\n"
"function in the `mix.exs` file to the following:\n"
"\n"
"    def application do\n"
"      [env: [hello: :world]]\n"
"    end\n"
"\n"
"In the application function, we can define the default environment values\n"
"for our application. By starting your application with `iex -S mix`, you\n"
"can access the default value:\n"
"\n"
"    Application.get_env(:APP_NAME, :hello)\n"
"    #=> :world\n"
"\n"
"It is also possible to put and delete values from the application value,\n"
"including new values that are not defined in the environment file (although\n"
"those should be avoided).\n"
"\n"
"In the future, we plan to support configuration files which allows\n"
"developers to configure the environment of their dependencies.\n"
"\n"
"Keep in mind that each application is responsible for its environment.\n"
"Do not use the functions in this module for directly access or modify\n"
"the environment of other application (as it may lead to inconsistent\n"
"data in the application environment).\n"
"\n"
"## Application module callback\n"
"\n"
"Often times, an application defines a supervision tree that must be started\n"
"and stopped when the application starts and stops. For such, we need to\n"
"define an application module callback. The first step is to define the\n"
"module callback in the application definition in the `mix.exs` file:\n"
"\n"
"    def application do\n"
"      [mod: {MyApp, []}]\n"
"    end\n"
"\n"
"Our application now requires the `MyApp` module to provide an application\n"
"callback. This can be done by invoking `use Application` in that module\n"
"and defining a `start/2` callback, for example:\n"
"\n"
"    defmodule MyApp do\n"
"      use Application\n"
"\n"
"      def start(_type, _args) do\n"
"        MyApp.Supervisor.start_link()\n"
"      end\n"
"    end\n"
"\n"
"`start/2` most commonly returns `{:ok, pid}` or `{:ok, pid, state}` where\n"
"`pid` identifies the supervision tree and the state is the application state.\n"
"`args` is second element of the tuple given to the `:mod` option.\n"
"\n"
"The `type` passed into `start/2` is usually `:normal` unless in a distributed\n"
"setup where applications takeovers and failovers are configured. This particular\n"
"aspect of applications can be read with more detail in the OTP documentation:\n"
"\n"
"  * http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/application.html\n"
"  * http://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/applications.html\n"
"\n"
"A developer may also implement the `stop/1` callback (automatically defined\n"
"by `use Application`) which does any application cleanup. It receives the\n"
"application state and can return any value. Notice that shutting down the\n"
"supervisor is automatically handled by the VM.\n"
