"Functions handling IO.\n"
"\n"
"Many functions in this module expect an IO device as an argument.\n"
"An IO device must be a pid or an atom representing a process.\n"
"For convenience, Elixir provides `:stdio` and `:stderr` as\n"
"shortcuts to Erlang's `:standard_io` and `:standard_error`.\n"
"\n"
"The majority of the functions expect char data, i.e. strings or\n"
"lists of characters and strings. In case another type is given,\n"
"functions will convert to string via the `String.Chars` protocol\n"
"(as shown in typespecs).\n"
"\n"
"The functions starting with `bin*` expect iodata as an argument,\n"
"i.e. binaries or lists of bytes and binaries.\n"
"\n"
"## IO devices\n"
"\n"
"An IO device may be an atom or a pid. In case it is an atom,\n"
"the atom must be the name of a registered process. In addition,\n"
"Elixir provides two shortcuts:\n"
"\n"
"  * `:stdio` - a shortcut for `:standard_io`, which maps to\n"
"    the current `Process.group_leader/0` in Erlang\n"
"\n"
"  * `:stderr` - a shortcut for the named process `:standard_error`\n"
"    provided in Erlang\n"
"\n"
"IO devices maintain their position, that means subsequent calls to any\n"
"reading or writing functions will start from the place when the device\n"
"was last accessed. Position of files can be changed using the\n"
"`:file.position/2` function.\n"
