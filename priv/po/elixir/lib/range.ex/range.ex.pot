"A range represents a discrete number of values where\n"
"the first and last values are integers.\n"
"\n"
"Ranges can be either increasing (first <= last) or\n"
"decreasing (first > last). Ranges are also always\n"
"inclusive.\n"

"A Range is represented internally as a struct. However,\n"
"the most common form of creating and matching on ranges\n"
"is via the `../2` macro, auto-imported from Kernel:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> range = 1..3\n"
"    1..3\n"
"    iex> first..last = range\n"
"    iex> first\n"
