#. TRANSLATORS: Elixir.GenEvent Summary
#: lib/gen_event.ex:2 
msgid ""
"A behaviour module for implementing event handling functionality.\n"
"\n"
"The event handling model consists of a generic event manager\n"
"process with an arbitrary number of event handlers which are\n"
"added and deleted dynamically.\n"
"\n"
"An event manager implemented using this module will have a standard\n"
"set of interface functions and include functionality for tracing and\n"
"error reporting. It will also fit into a supervision tree.\n"
"\n"
"## Example\n"
"\n"
"There are many use cases for event handlers. For example, a logging\n"
"system can be built using event handlers where each log message is\n"
"an event and different event handlers can be plugged to handle the\n"
"log messages. One handler may print error messages on the terminal,\n"
"another can write it to a file, while a third one can keep the\n"
"messages in memory (like a buffer) until they are read.\n"
"\n"
"As an example, let's have a GenEvent that accumulates messages until\n"
"they are collected by an explicit call.\n"

"\n"
"We can add new handlers with `add_handler/3` and `add_mon_handler/3`.\n"
"Calls can also be made to specific handlers by using `call/3`.\n"
"\n"
"## Callbacks\n"
"\n"
"There are 6 callbacks required to be implemented in a `GenEvent`. By\n"
"adding `use GenEvent` to your module, Elixir will automatically define\n"
"all 6 callbacks for you, leaving it up to you to implement the ones\n"
"you want to customize.\n"
"\n"
"## Name Registration\n"
"\n"
"A GenEvent is bound to the same name registration rules as a `GenServer`.\n"
"Read more about it in the `GenServer` docs.\n"
"\n"
"## Modes\n"
"\n"
"GenEvent stream supports three different notifications.\n"
"\n"
"On `GenEvent.ack_notify/2`, the manager acknowledges each event,\n"
"providing backpressure, but processing of the message happens\n"
"asynchronously.\n"
"\n"
"On `GenEvent.sync_notify/2`, the manager acknowledges an event\n"
"just after it was processed by all event handlers.\n"
"\n"
"On `GenEvent.notify/2`, all events are processed asynchronously and\n"
"there is no ack (which means there is no backpressure).\n"
"\n"
"## Streaming\n"
"\n"
"`GenEvent` messages can be streamed with the help of `stream/2`.\n"
"You will need to start another process to consume the stream:\n"
"\n"
"    Task.start_link fn ->\n"
"      stream = GenEvent.stream(pid)\n"
"\n"
"      # Discard the next 3 events\n"
"      _ = Enum.drop(stream, 3)\n"
"\n"
"      # Print all remaining events\n"
"      for event <- stream do\n"
"        IO.inspect event\n"
"      end\n"
