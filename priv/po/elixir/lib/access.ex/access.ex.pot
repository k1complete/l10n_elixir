"Key-based access to data structures via the `foo[bar]` bracket syntax.\n"
"\n"
"Elixir provides two syntaxes for accessing values. `user[:name]`\n"
"is used by dynamic structures, like maps and keywords, while\n"
"`user.name` is used by structs. The main difference is that\n"
"`user[:name]` won't raise if the key `:name` is missing but\n"
"`user.name` will raise if there is no `:name` key.\n"
"\n"
"Besides the cases above, this module provides convenience\n"
"functions for accessing other structures, like `at/1` for\n"
"lists and `elem/1` for tuples. Those functions can be used\n"
"by the nested update functions in `Kernel`, such as\n"
"`Kernel.get_in/2`, `Kernel.put_in/3`, `Kernel.update_in/3`,\n"
"`Kernel.get_and_update_in/3` and friends.\n"
"\n"
"## Key-based lookups\n"
"\n"
"Out of the box, Access works with `Keyword` and `Map`:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> keywords = [a: 1, b: 2]\n"
"    iex> keywords[:a]\n"
"    1\n"
"\n"
"    iex> map = %{a: 1, b: 2}\n"
"    iex> map[:a]\n"
"    1\n"
"\n"
"    iex> star_ratings = %{1.0 => \"★\", 1.5 => \"★☆\", 2.0 => \"★★\"}\n"
"    iex> star_ratings[1.5]\n"
"    \"★☆\"\n"
"\n"
"Access can be combined with `Kernel.put_in/3` to put a value\n"
"in a given key:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> map = %{a: 1, b: 2}\n"
"    iex> put_in map[:a], 3\n"
"    %{a: 3, b: 2}\n"
"\n"
"This syntax is very convenient as it can be nested arbitrarily:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> users = %{\"john\" => %{age: 27}, \"meg\" => %{age: 23}}\n"
"    iex> put_in users[\"john\"][:age], 28\n"
"    %{\"john\" => %{age: 28}, \"meg\" => %{age: 23}}\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, Access transparently ignores `nil` values:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> keywords = [a: 1, b: 2]\n"
"    iex> keywords[:c][:unknown]\n"
"    nil\n"
"\n"
"Since Access is a behaviour, it can be implemented to key-value\n"
"data structures. Access requires the key comparison to be\n"
"implemented using the `===` operator.\n"
"\n"
"## Field-based lookups\n"
"\n"
"The Access syntax (`foo[bar]`) cannot be used to access fields in\n"
"structs. That's by design, as Access is meant to be used for\n"
"dynamic key-value structures, like maps and keywords, and not\n"
"by static ones like structs.\n"
"\n"
"Therefore Elixir provides a field-based lookup for structs.\n"
"Imagine a struct named `User` with name and age fields. The\n"
"following would raise:\n"
"\n"
"    user = %User{name: \"john\"}\n"
"    user[:name]\n"
"    ** (UndefinedFunctionError) undefined function User.fetch/2\n"
"       (User does not implement the Access behaviour)\n"
"\n"
"Structs instead use the `user.name` syntax:\n"
"\n"
"    user.name\n"
"    #=> \"john\"\n"
"\n"
"The same `user.name` syntax can also be used by `Kernel.put_in/2`\n"
"to for updating structs fields:\n"
"\n"
"    put_in user.name, \"mary\"\n"
"    %User{name: \"mary\"}\n"
"\n"
"Differently from `user[:name]`, `user.name` is not extensible and\n"
"is restricted to only maps and structs.\n"
"\n"
"Summing up:\n"
"\n"
"  * `user[:name]` is used by dynamic structures, is extensible and\n"
"    does not raise on missing keys\n"
"  * `user.name` is used by static structures, it is not extensible\n"
"    and it will raise on missing keys\n"
"\n"
"## Accessors\n"
"\n"
"While Elixir provides built-in syntax only for traversing dynamic\n"
"and static key-value structures, this module provides convenience\n"
"functions for traversing other structures, like tuples and lists,\n"
"to be used alongside `Kernel.put_in/2` in others.\n"
"\n"
"**TODO: implement `field/1`, `key/1`, `at/1`, `elem/1`.**\n"
