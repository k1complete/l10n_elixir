"A String in Elixir is a UTF-8 encoded binary.\n"
"\n"
"## Codepoints and graphemes\n"
"\n"
"The functions in this module act according to the Unicode\n"
"Standard, version 6.3.0. As per the standard, a codepoint is\n"
"a Unicode Character, which may be represented by one or more\n"
"bytes. For example, the character \"é\" is represented with two\n"
"bytes:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> byte_size(\"é\")\n"
"    2\n"
"\n"
"However, this module returns the proper length:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> String.length(\"é\")\n"
"    1\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, this module also presents the concept of\n"
"graphemes, which are multiple characters that may be\n"
"\"perceived as a single character\" by readers. For example,\n"
"the same \"é\" character written above could be represented\n"
"by the letter \"e\" followed by the accent ́:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> string = \"\\u0065\\u0301\"\n"
"    iex> byte_size(string)\n"
"    3\n"
"    iex> String.length(string)\n"
"    1\n"
"\n"
"Although the example above is made of two characters, it is\n"
"perceived by users as one.\n"
"\n"
"Graphemes can also be two characters that are interpreted\n"
"as one by some languages. For example, some languages may\n"
"consider \"ch\" as a grapheme. However, since this information\n"
"depends on the locale, it is not taken into account by this\n"
"module.\n"
"\n"
"In general, the functions in this module rely on the Unicode\n"
"Standard, but do not contain any of the locale specific behaviour.\n"
"\n"
"More information about graphemes can be found in the [Unicode\n"
"Standard Annex #29](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/).\n"
"This current Elixir version implements Extended Grapheme Cluster\n"
"algorithm.\n"
"\n"
"## String and binary operations\n"
"\n"
"To act accordingly to the Unicode Standard, many functions\n"
"in this module runs in linear time, as it needs to traverse\n"
"the whole string considering the proper Unicode codepoints.\n"
"\n"
"For example, `String.length/1` is going to take longer as\n"
"the input grows. On the other hand, `Kernel.byte_size/1` always runs\n"
"in constant time (i.e. regardless of the input size).\n"
"\n"
"This means often there are performance costs in using the\n"
"functions in this module, compared to the more low-level\n"
"operations that work directly with binaries:\n"
"\n"
"  * `Kernel.binary_part/3` - retrieves part of the binary\n"
"  * `Kernel.bit_size/1` and `Kernel.byte_size/1` - size related functions\n"
"  * `Kernel.is_bitstring/1` and `Kernel.is_binary/1` - type checking function\n"
"  * Plus a number of functions for working with binaries (bytes)\n"
"    [in the `:binary` module](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/binary.html)\n"
"\n"
"There are many situations where using the `String` module can\n"
"be avoided in favor of binary functions or pattern matching.\n"
"For example, imagine you have a string `prefix` and you want to\n"
"remove this prefix from another string named `full`.\n"
"\n"
"One may be tempted to write:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> take_prefix = fn full, prefix ->\n"
"    ...>   base = String.length(prefix)\n"
"    ...>   String.slice(full, base, String.length(full) - base)\n"
"    ...> end\n"
"    iex> take_prefix.(\"Mr. John\", \"Mr. \")\n"
"    \"John\"\n"
"\n"
"Although the function above works, it performs poorly. To\n"
"calculate the length of the string, we need to traverse it\n"
"fully, so we traverse both `prefix` and `full` strings, then\n"
"slice the `full` one, traversing it again.\n"
"\n"
"A first attempting at improving it could be with ranges:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> take_prefix = fn full, prefix ->\n"
"    ...>   base = String.length(prefix)\n"
"    ...>   String.slice(full, base..-1)\n"
"    ...> end\n"
"    iex> take_prefix.(\"Mr. John\", \"Mr. \")\n"
"    \"John\"\n"
"\n"
"While this is much better (we don't traverse `full` twice),\n"
"it could still be improved. In this case, since we want to\n"
"extract a substring from a string, we can use `byte_size/1`\n"
"and `binary_part/3` as there is no chance we will slice in\n"
"the middle of a codepoint made of more than one byte:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> take_prefix = fn full, prefix ->\n"
"    ...>   base = byte_size(prefix)\n"
"    ...>   binary_part(full, base, byte_size(full) - base)\n"
"    ...> end\n"
"    iex> take_prefix.(\"Mr. John\", \"Mr. \")\n"
"    \"John\"\n"
"\n"
"Or simply use pattern matching:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> take_prefix = fn full, prefix ->\n"
"    ...>   base = byte_size(prefix)\n"
"    ...>   <<_ :: binary-size(base), rest :: binary>> = full\n"
"    ...>   rest\n"
"    ...> end\n"
"    iex> take_prefix.(\"Mr. John\", \"Mr. \")\n"
"    \"John\"\n"
"\n"
"On the other hand, if you want to dynamically slice a string\n"
"based on an integer value, then using `String.slice/3` is the\n"
"best option as it guarantees we won't incorrectly split a valid\n"
"codepoint in multiple bytes.\n"
"\n"
"## Integer codepoints\n"
"\n"
"Although codepoints could be represented as integers, this\n"
"module represents all codepoints as strings. For example:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> String.codepoints(\"olá\")\n"
"    [\"o\", \"l\", \"á\"]\n"
"\n"
"There are a couple of ways to retrieve a character integer\n"
"codepoint. One may use the `?` construct:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> ?o\n"
"    111\n"
"\n"
"    iex> ?á\n"
"    225\n"
"\n"
"Or also via pattern matching:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> << eacute :: utf8 >> = \"á\"\n"
"    iex> eacute\n"
"    225\n"
"\n"
"As we have seen above, codepoints can be inserted into\n"
"a string by their hexadecimal code:\n"
"\n"
"    \"ol\\u0061\\u0301\" #=>\n"
"    \"olá\"\n"
"\n"
"## Self-synchronization\n"
"\n"
"The UTF-8 encoding is self-synchronizing. This means that\n"
"if malformed data (i.e., data that is not possible according\n"
"to the definition of the encoding) is encountered, only one\n"
"codepoint needs to be rejected.\n"
"\n"
"This module relies on this behaviour to ignore such invalid\n"
"characters. For example, `length/1` is going to return\n"
"a correct result even if an invalid codepoint is fed into it.\n"
"\n"
"In other words, this module expects invalid data to be detected\n"
"when retrieving data from the external source. For example, a\n"
"driver that reads strings from a database will be the one\n"
"responsible to check the validity of the encoding.\n"
"\n"
"## Patterns\n"
"\n"
"Many functions in this module work with patterns. For example,\n"
"String.split/2 can split a string into multiple patterns given\n"
"a pattern. This pattern can be a string, a list of strings or\n"
"a compiled pattern:\n"
"\n"
"    iex> String.split(\"foo bar\", \" \")\n"
"    [\"foo\", \"bar\"]\n"
"\n"
"    iex> String.split(\"foo bar!\", [\" \", \"!\"])\n"
"    [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"\"]\n"
"\n"
"    iex> pattern = :binary.compile_pattern([\" \", \"!\"])\n"
"    iex> String.split(\"foo bar!\", pattern)\n"
"    [\"foo\", \"bar\", \"\"]\n"
"\n"
"The compiled pattern is useful when the same match will\n"
"be done over and over again. Note though the compiled\n"
"pattern cannot be stored in a module attribute as the pattern\n"
"is generated at runtime and does not survive compile term.\n"
