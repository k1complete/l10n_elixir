#. TRANSLATORS: Elixir.Supervisor.Spec Summary
#: lib/supervisor/spec.ex:2 
msgid ""
"Convenience functions for defining a supervision specification.\n"
"\n"
"## Example\n"
"\n"
"By using the functions in this module one can define a supervisor\n"
"and start it with `Supervisor.start_link/2`:\n"
"\n"
"    import Supervisor.Spec\n"
"\n"
"    children = [\n"
"      worker(MyWorker, [arg1, arg2, arg3]),\n"
"      supervisor(MySupervisor, [arg1])\n"
"    ]\n"
"\n"
"    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)\n"
"\n"
"In many situations, it may be handy to define supervisors backed\n"
"by a module:\n"
"\n"
"    defmodule MySupervisor do\n"
"      use Supervisor\n"
"\n"
"      def start_link(arg) do\n"
"        Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, arg)\n"
"      end\n"
"\n"
"      def init(arg) do\n"
"        children = [\n"
"          worker(MyWorker, [arg], restart: :temporary)\n"
"        ]\n"
"\n"
"        supervise(children, strategy: :simple_one_for_one)\n"
"      end\n"
"    end\n"
"\n"
"Notice in this case we don't have to explicitly import\n"
"`Supervisor.Spec` as `use Supervisor` automatically does so.\n"
"\n"
"Explicit supervisors as above are required when there is a need to:\n"
"\n"
"  1. Partially change the supervision tree during hot-code swaps.\n"
"\n"
"  2. Define supervisors inside other supervisors.\n"
"\n"
"  3. Perform actions inside the supervision `init/1` callback.\n"
"\n"
"     For example, you may want to start an ETS table that is linked to\n"
"     the supervisor (i.e. if the supervision tree needs to be restarted,\n"
"     the ETS table must be restarted too).\n"
"\n"
"## Supervisor and worker options\n"
"\n"
"In the example above, we have defined workers and supervisors\n"
"and each accepts the following options:\n"
"\n"
"  * `:id` - a name used to identify the child specification\n"
"    internally by the supervisor; defaults to the given module\n"
"    name\n"
"\n"
"  * `:function` - the function to invoke on the child to start it\n"
"\n"
"  * `:restart` - defines when the child process should restart\n"
"\n"
"  * `:shutdown` - defines how a child process should be terminated\n"
"\n"
"  * `:modules` - it should be a list with one element `[module]`,\n"
"    where module is the name of the callback module only if the\n"
"    child process is a `Supervisor` or `GenServer`; if the child\n"
"    process is a `GenEvent`, modules should be `:dynamic`\n"
"\n"
"### Restart values (:restart)\n"
"\n"
"The following restart values are supported:\n"
"\n"
"  * `:permanent` - the child process is always restarted\n"
"\n"
"  * `:temporary` - the child process is never restarted (not even\n"
"    when the supervisor's strategy is `:rest_for_one` or `:one_for_all`)\n"
"\n"
"  * `:transient` - the child process is restarted only if it\n"
"    terminates abnormally, i.e. with another exit reason than\n"
"    `:normal`, `:shutdown` or `{:shutdown, term}`\n"
"\n"
"### Shutdown values (:shutdown)\n"
"\n"
"The following shutdown values are supported:\n"
"\n"
"  * `:brutal_kill` - the child process is unconditionally terminated\n"
"    using `exit(child, :kill)`.\n"
"\n"
"  * `:infinity` - if the child process is a supervisor, it is a mechanism\n"
"    to give the subtree enough time to shutdown. It can also be used with\n"
"    workers with care.\n"
"\n"
"  * Finally, it can also be any integer meaning that the supervisor tells\n"
"    the child process to terminate by calling `Process.exit(child, :shutdown)`\n"
"    and then waits for an exit signal back. If no exit signal is received\n"
"    within the specified time (in milliseconds), the child process is\n"
"    unconditionally terminated using `Process.exit(child, :kill)`.\n"
