"## Versions\n"
"\n"
"In a nutshell, a version is given by three numbers:\n"
"\n"
"    MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH\n"
"\n"
"Pre-releases are supported by appending `-[0-9A-Za-z-\\.]`:\n"
"\n"
"    \"1.0.0-alpha.3\"\n"

"Build information can be added by appending `+[0-9A-Za-z-\\.]`:\n"

"    \"1.0.0-alpha.3+20130417140000\"\n"
"\n"
"## Struct\n"
"\n"
"The version is represented by the Version struct and it has its\n"
"fields named according to Semver: `:major`, `:minor`, `:patch`,\n"
"`:pre` and `:build`.\n"
"\n"
"## Requirements\n"
"\n"
"Requirements allow you to specify which versions of a given\n"
"dependency you are willing to work against. It supports common\n"
"operators like `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `==` and friends that\n"
"work as one would expect:\n"
"\n"
"    # Only version 2.0.0\n"
"    \"== 2.0.0\"\n"
"\n"
"    # Anything later than 2.0.0\n"
"    \"> 2.0.0\"\n"
"\n"
"Requirements also support `and` and `or` for complex conditions:\n"
"\n"
"    # 2.0.0 and later until 2.1.0\n"
"    \">= 2.0.0 and < 2.1.0\"\n"
"\n"
"Since the example above is such a common requirement, it can\n"
"be expressed as:\n"
"\n"
"    \"~> 2.0.0\"\n"
