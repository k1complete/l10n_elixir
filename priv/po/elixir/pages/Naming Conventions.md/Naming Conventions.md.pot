msgid "Elixir developers must use `snake_case` when defining variables, function names, module attributes, etc:"
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Naming Conventions.md:12
msgid "Aliases, commonly used as module names, are an exception as they must be capitalized and written in `CamelCase`, like `OptionParser`. For aliases, capital letters are kept in acronyms, like `ExUnit.CaptureIO` or `Mix.SCM`."
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Naming Conventions.md:14
msgid "Atoms can be written either in `:snake_case` or `:CamelCase`, although the convention is to use the snake case version throughout Elixir."
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Naming Conventions.md:16
msgid "Generally speaking, filenames follow the `snake_case` convention of the module they define. For example, `MyApp` should be defined inside the `my_app.ex` file. However, this is only a convention. At the end of the day, any filename can be used as they do not affect the compiled code in any way."

msgid "Elixir relies on underscores in different situations."
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Naming Conventions.md:22
msgid "For example, a value that is not meant to be used must be assigned to `_` or to a variable starting with underscore:"
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Naming Conventions.md:26
msgid "Function names may also start with an underscore. Such functions are never imported by default:"
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Naming Conventions.md:38
msgid "Due to this property, Elixir relies on functions starting with underscore to attach compile-time metadata to modules. Such functions are most often in the `__foo__` format. For example, every module in Elixir has an `__info__` function:"
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Naming Conventions.md:43
msgid "Elixir also includes 4 special variables that follow the double underscore format. These forms retrieve compile-time information about the current environment: `__MODULE__`, `__DIR__`, `__ENV__` and `__CALLER__`."

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Naming Conventions.md:49
msgid "Many functions come in pairs, such as `File.read/1` and `File.read!/1`. `File.read/1` will return a success or failure tuple, whereas `File.read!/1` will return a plain value or else raise an exception:"

msgid "The version without `!` is preferred when you want to handle different outcomes using pattern matching:"
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Naming Conventions.md:68
msgid "However, if you expect the outcome to always to be successful (e.g. if you expect the file always to exist), the bang variation can be more convenient and will raise a more helpful error message (than a failed pattern match) on failure."
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Naming Conventions.md:70
msgid "More examples of paired functions: `Base.decode16/2` and `Base.decode16!/2`, `File.cwd/0` and `File.cwd!/0`"
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Naming Conventions.md:72
msgid "There are also some non-paired functions, with no non-bang variant. The bang still signifies that it will raise an exception on failure. Examples: `Mix.Config.validate!/1`, `Protocol.assert_protocol!/1`"
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Naming Conventions.md:74
msgid "In macro code, the bang on `Kernel.alias!/1` and `Kernel.var!/2` signifies that [macro hygiene](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/meta/macros.html#macros-hygiene) is set aside."

msgid "Examples: `Integer.is_even/1`, `Kernel.is_list/1`"
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Naming Conventions.md:90
msgid "These functions and macros follow the Erlang convention of an `is_` prefix, instead of a trailing question mark, precisely to indicate that they are allowed in guard clauses."
