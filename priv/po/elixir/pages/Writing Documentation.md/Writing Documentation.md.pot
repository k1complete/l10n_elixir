msgid "The `@moduledoc` attribute is used to add documentation to the module. `@doc` is used before a function to provide documentation for it. Besides the attributes above, `@typedoc` can also be used to attach documentation to types defined as part of typespecs."

msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Writing Documentation.md:53
msgid "There are a couple tips we recommend developers to follow when writing documentation:"
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Writing Documentation.md:55
msgid "  * Keep the first paragraph of the documentation concise and simple, typically one-line. Tools like ExDoc uses the first line to generate a summary."
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Writing Documentation.md:57
msgid "  * Markdown uses backticks (`` ` ``) to quote code. Elixir builds on top of that to automatically generate links when modules or function names are referenced. For this reason, always use full module names. If you have a module called `MyApp.Hello`, always reference it as `` `MyApp.Hello` `` and never as `` `Hello` ``. Function names must be referenced by name and arity if they are local, as in `` `world/1` ``, or by module, name and arity if pointing to an external module: `` `MyApp.Hello.world/1` ``. Referencing a `@callback` can be done by prepending `c:`, as in `` `c:world/1` ``."
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Writing Documentation.md:59
msgid "  * When the documentation has multiple sections, always start the section heading by using `##`. The first heading is reserved to the module or function name itself."
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Writing Documentation.md:61
msgid "  * When documenting a function with multiple clauses, the documentation must be placed before the first clause. Documentation is always per function and not per clause."
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Writing Documentation.md:63
msgid "## Doctests"
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Writing Documentation.md:65
msgid "We recommend developers to include examples in their documentation, often under its own `## Examples` heading. To ensure examples do not get out of date, Elixir's test framework (ExUnit) provides a feature called doctests that allows developers to test the examples in their documentation. Doctests work by parsing out code samples starting with `iex>` from the documentation. You can read more about it at `ExUnit.DocTest`."
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Writing Documentation.md:67
msgid "Notice doctests have limitations. When you cannot doctest a function, because it relies on state or side-effects, we recommend developers to include examples directly without the `iex>` prompt."

msgid "## Documentation != Comments"
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Writing Documentation.md:71
msgid "Elixir treats documentation and code comments as different concepts. Documentation are for users of your Application Programming Interface (API), be it your co-worker or your future self. Modules and functions must always be documented if they are part of your API."
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Writing Documentation.md:73
msgid "Code comments are for developers reading the code. They are useful to mark improvements, leave notes for developers reading the code (for example, you decided to not call a function due to a bug in a library) and so forth."
msgstr ""

msgid "## Privacy"
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Writing Documentation.md:79
msgid "Elixir does not allow developers to document private functions. That's because private functions only exist inside the module that define them and cannot be accessed externally."
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Writing Documentation.md:81
msgid "Luckily, Elixir allows developers to hide modules and functions from the documentation. For example, one common practice for documenting internal behaviour is to set the `@moduledoc` attribute to false while documenting each function:"
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Writing Documentation.md:94
msgid "Similarly, developers can add `@doc false` to functions they do not want to publicly expose:"
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Writing Documentation.md:101
msgid "However keep in mind adding `@doc false` does not make the function private. The function above can still be invoked as `MyApp.Sample.add(1, 2)`. Not only that, if the `MyApp.Sample` is imported, the `add/2` function will also be imported into the caller. For those reasons, be cautious when adding `@doc false` to functions, instead prefer one of:"
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Writing Documentation.md:103
msgid "  * Move the undocumented function to a module with `@moduledoc false`, like `MyApp.Hidden`, ensuring the function won't be accidentally exposed or imported. Remember you can use `@moduledoc false` to hide a whole module and still document each function with `@doc`. Tools will still ignore the module."
msgstr ""

#: deps/elixir/lib/elixir/pages/Writing Documentation.md:105
msgid "  * Start the function name with underscores, for example, `__add__/2`, and add `@doc false`. The compiler does not import functions with underscore and the underscore will hint of its intended private usage."

"Elixir stores documentation inside pre-defined chunks in the bytecode. It can be accessed from Elixir by using the `Code.get_docs/2` function. This also means documentation is only accessed when required and not when modules are loaded by the Virtual Machine. The only downside is that modules defined in-memory, like the ones defined in IEx, cannot have their documentation accessed as they do not have their bytecode written to disk.\n"
